# EndermanMobs
Required Plugin: https://modrinth.com/plugin/kotlinplugins
- Makes mobs capable of teleporting.
- Teleporting works this way: Hostile mobs from the range of 20 blocks from the player are teleported nearby the player, not too close but also not too far. 
- The teleportation doesn't make enderman sounds so it looks more reliable.
